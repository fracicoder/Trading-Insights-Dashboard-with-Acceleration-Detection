# Trading Assistant

A lightweight trading assistant developed for a client, featuring a simple UI. The tool reads structured `.txt` files, processes data in the backend, and generates a key metric — **Outnumber** — along with insightful visualizations. These outputs assist the client in making data-driven decisions for options trading strategies.
